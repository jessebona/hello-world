# hello-world
I spent over 5 years studying to be a software developer and have well practiced skills in a number of languages
including C, Java and Python. In the last 9 months I got my first taste of full time work managing a website for an online business.
There wasn't much programming involved but I did gain some valuable customer service and IT troubleshooting experience as well as some
practice in minor website maintenance using PHP and SQL.
